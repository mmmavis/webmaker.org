      <h1>Webmaker Terms</h1>
      <h3>June 15, 2013</h3>
      <p>At Mozilla, we are committed to promoting choice and innovation on the 
        web and helping users realize the full potential of the web.  That’s why 
        we created Webmaker – a site where users can learn about web technologies 
        by submitting and mashing up their content and allowing others to mash 
        up their content using web technologies.</p>

      <p>As a user, your use of Webmaker is subject to the terms and conditions 
        of this Terms of Use as well as the related policies referred to in 
        these Terms or elsewhere on Webmaker (we will refer to these 
        collectively as the “Terms”).</p>

        or if applicable, your employer or other entity that you represent.</p>

      <h2>Modifications to the Terms</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to change these Terms at our sole discretion,

        prior to those terms coming into effect.</p>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>

      <p>Webmaker provides tools that enable our users to arrange physical 
        meetings at various venues. We do not supervise these meetings and 
        are not involved in any way with the actions of any individuals at 
        these meetings. As a result, we have no control over the identity or 
        actions of the individuals who are present at these meetings, and we 
        request that you exercise caution and good judgment when attending them.</p>

        acknowledge that we: (i) do not supervise or control the meetings or 
        interactions between users (sometimes even if the events use the 
        term “Mozilla” or “Moz” in the title), (ii) are not involved in any 
        way with physical transportation to or from meetings or with the actions 
        of any individuals at those meetings, (iii) do not control users or

        meetings or people attending them. </p>

      <h2>Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice</h2>
      <p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent of a copyright owner and believe 
        that content available by means of one of Mozilla’s websites infringes one 
        or more of your copyrights, please immediately notify Mozilla’s Copyright 
        Agent by means of emailed, mailed, or faxed notice ("DMCA Notice") and 
        include the information described below. You can review 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) 
        of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for authoritative detail, or 
        consult your own attorney if you need assistance. If Mozilla takes action 
        in response to a DMCA Notice, it will make a good faith attempt to contact 
        the party that made such content available by means of the most recent 
        email address, if any, provided by such party to Mozilla. You may be held 
        liable for damages based on certain material misrepresentations contained 
        in a DMCA Notice. Thus, if you are not sure content located on or 
        linked to by the website infringes your copyright, 
        you should consider first contacting an attorney.</p>

      <p>All DMCA Notices should include the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>A signature, electronic or physical, of the owner, or a person 
          authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive copyright 
          right that is being infringed;</li>
        <li>An identification of the copyrighted work or works that you claim 
          have been infringed;</li>
        <li>A description of the nature and location of the material that you 
          claim to infringe your copyright, in sufficient detail to permit Mozilla 
          to find and positively identify that content, including the URL where 
          it is located;</li>
        <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and email address where we 
          can contact you; and</li>
        <li>A statement by you: (i) that you believe in good faith that the use 
          of the material that you claim infringes your copyright is not authorized 
          by law, or by the copyright owner or such owner's agent; and, (ii) 
          that all of the information contained in your DMCA Notice is accurate, 
          and under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of, or a 
          person authorized to act on behalf an owner of, the exclusive copyright 
          right that is being infringed.</li>
      </ol>

          viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email 
          address associated with your account or the next time you 
          attempt to access your account.</p>

          United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods and the 
          Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, however designated, 
          are excluded and shall not apply to this Agreement or any transactions 
          hereunder. You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction 
          of the state courts and federal courts located within Santa Clara County,

        <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>You may not assign your rights or delegate its obligations under these Terms.  
          These Terms are not intended to benefit, nor shall it be deemed to give 
          rise to, any rights in any third party. Our relationship is that of 
          independent contractors:  these Terms shall not be construed to create 
          a joint venture or partnership between the parties.  Neither party shall 
          be deemed to be an employee, agent, partner or legal representative of 
          the other for any purpose and neither shall have any right, power or 
          authority to create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of the other. 
          These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties with 
          respect to the subject matter hereof.  These Terms supersede, and govern, 
          any other prior or collateral agreements with respect to the subject 
          matter hereof. If any provision of these Terms are held or made invalid 
          or unenforceable for any reason, such invalidity shall not affect the 
          remainder of these Terms, and the invalid or unenforceable provisions 
          shall be replaced by a mutually acceptable provision, which being valid, 
          legal and enforceable comes closest to the original intentions of the 
          parties hereto and has like economic effect.  The failure of either party 
          at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall 
          in no manner affect the right at a later time to enforce the same.  
          No waiver by either party of the breach of any term or covenant contained 
          in these Terms, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, 
          shall be deemed to be, or construed as, a further or continuing waiver 
          of any such breach or a waiver of the breach of any other term 
          or covenant contained in these Terms.</p>
